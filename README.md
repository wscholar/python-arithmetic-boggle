# A function that takes as input, a target integer and a sequence of integers (space delimited list)
# returns true if the target integer can be obtained by placing
# addition or subtraction operations in the list. Otherwise, returns false.
#
# For example:
#
# f(5, [5, 2]) = false. There's no way to add or subtract 5 and 2 to get 5.
# f(13, [3, 9, 3, 2]) = true. 3 + 9 + 3 - 2 = 13.
